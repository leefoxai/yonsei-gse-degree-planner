## Application regression

```text
PASS - All plans: 24 current credits, 30 projected credits, current GPA only
PASS - Selected mode starts with no implicit semester; checkbox changes recompute results
PASS - Selection survives save/reload and old backups default to all plans
PASS - Only the active scenario is projected; a stale selection adds no courses
PASS - Duplicate planned course does not double count; failed history can be planned again
PASS - Teacher current/projected values and summary use the same three states
PASS - Teacher score cards explain thresholds; failing scores remain in action items
PASS - Comprehensive and English exam edits refresh the action summary immediately
PASS - Teacher non-course checkbox edits refresh the action summary immediately
PASS - Planned credits never imply a passing future GPA
PASS - A planned teaching practicum is labelled planned, not already completed
PASS - Counselor certificate variant edits refresh eligibility actions
PASS - Steps open on entry, including saved sessions; edits preserve manual folding
PASS - Navigation opens the plan and its ancestor, never the unrelated catalog
Application regression: 14/14 passed
